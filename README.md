# ♻️ Recycling System

A simple and user-friendly recycling system application built with Python and Tkinter. It allows users to add recyclable items, view the total reward accumulated, and reset the system with ease.

## 🚀 Setup and Run Instructions

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x** must be installed on your system.
- **Tkinter**: It usually comes pre-installed with Python. If not, install it using:
  ```bash
  pip install tk
Steps to Set Up and Run
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/Malharc2/recycling-system1.git
cd recycling-system1
Navigate to the project directory:
cd path/to/your/project
Run the application:
python d.py


🗂️ Code Structure
			d.py: 																									This is the main file containing the implementation of the recycling system and the GUI.
	Item class: Represents a recyclable item with attributes for item type, reward, shape, and weight.
	RecyclingSystem class: Manages the recycling system, including adding items, calculating total rewards, and resetting the system.
	RecyclingSystemGUI class: Implements the Tkinter-based GUI for the recycling system.
	main function: Initializes and runs the Tkinter GUI application.


📋 Assumptions and Design Decisions
						Item Types: 																					The system supports three types of recyclable items: Type A, Type B, and Type C.
	Rewards: Each item type has a predefined reward:
	Type A: 0.10 INR
	Type B: 0.05 INR
	Type C: 0.15 INR
					Attributes:																							Each item can have optional attributes for shape and weight, although these are not used in reward calculation.
		GUI Implementation: The application uses Tkinter for the graphical user interface, providing a simple way for users to interact with the system.
		Modularity: The code is organized into classes to promote modularity and ease of maintenance.
		🌟 Features
		Add Items: Easily add recyclable items of types A, B, or C.
		View Rewards: View the total reward accumulated from recycling items.
		Reset System: Reset the system to clear all items and reset the total reward.
